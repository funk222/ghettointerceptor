This work is for proof of concept only - it does not comply with ISO 26262 ASIL-D and should NOT be used on public roads. You have been warned.
The purpose of this project is to show a method by which electric power steering columns may be commanded over the CAN bus, allowing the possibility to retrofit ADAS or enable self-driving in older cars that don't have factory-built acutators in place. As a proof of concept, it contains NO SAFETY CODE and NO FAILSAFES. Please only use this as a reference, and NEVER use it in an actual car on public roads.
